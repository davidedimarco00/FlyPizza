FlyPizza, Intelligent Systems Engineering Project

This project is a MAS (Multi-Agent System) composed by 3 Entities: 
  1) Pizzeria: this agent is the core of the project, it manages orders assigning them to drones. To store orders a queue, intended as data structure, is used. For simplicity orders are generated by the pizzeria itself. In a real environment the orders arrive from the environment (maybe a caller or customers) 
  2) Robot: The robot is responsible to make recovery of damaged drones. It recover them, bring them to pizzeria and repair it.
  3) Drone: in this simulation the drone are three. They take the orders from the pizzeria and bring them to destination. They move around the map autonomosly and avoiding obstacles.
